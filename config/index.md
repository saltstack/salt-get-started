SaltStack's configuration management system let's you define the applications,
files, and other settings that should be in place on a specific system. The
system is continuously evaluated against the defined configuration, and changes
are made as needed.

This Getting Started guide walks you through the essentials of SaltStack's
Configuration Management capabilities.

If you completed [SaltStack Fundamentals](../fundamentals/), you
already know:

- How to write and save a simple Salt state
- How to apply a Salt state file from the command line
- How to target Salt states using the state Top file

This guide builds on these concepts and explains Salt state function calls,
includes, requisites, and Jinja.
